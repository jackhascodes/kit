Logger provides a highly customisable Log with:
* sensible defaults
* pre- and post-processing capabilities (interceptors)
* spawnable sub-logs which can be modified/customised on their own
* extensible formatting
* custom timestamps
* optional prefixing
* custom exit behaviour on panic and fatal events.

See the `Log` type in [godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/jackhascodes/kit/log#Log) for examples.
